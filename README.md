# APIWork - Student & Subject API

## Overview
APIWork is a RESTful API built using **Spring Boot** and **MySQL**. It provides endpoints to fetch student details and subjects offered in the **Software Engineering** program from Year 1 to Year 4.

## Features
- Retrieve a list of students and their enrolled programs.
- Retrieve a structured list of subjects categorized by academic year.
- Uses **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **MySQL** as the database.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** (Backend Framework)
- **Spring Data JPA** (Database Interaction)
- **MySQL** (Database)
- **Postman** (API Testing)
- **AWS** (Deployment)
- **GitHub** (Version Control)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Java 17 or later
- MySQL Database
- Maven
- Git

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apiwork.git
cd apiwork
```

### Configure Database
Update **`application.properties`** (located in `src/main/resources/`):
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/apiwork
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

### Build and Run the Application
```sh
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Get All Students
**Endpoint:** `GET /students`
- **Description:** Returns a list of students and their enrolled programs.
- **Response Example:**
```json
[
  { "name": "Juma Hassan", "program": "Software Engineering" },
  { "name": "Neema John", "program": "Computer Science" }
]
```

### 2. Get Subjects by Year
**Endpoint:** `GET /subjects`
- **Description:** Returns subjects categorized by academic year.
- **Response Example:**
```json
{
  "Year 1": ["Introduction to Programming", "Mathematics for Computing"],
  "Year 2": ["Object-Oriented Programming", "Database Systems"],
  "Year 3": ["Software Architecture", "Machine Learning"],
  "Year 4": ["Cloud Computing", "Cyber Security"]
}
```

## Testing with Postman
1. Open **Postman**.
2. Use `GET http://localhost:8080/students` to fetch student data.
3. Use `GET http://localhost:8080/subjects` to fetch subjects.

## Version Control with Git
### Initialize Repository
```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/apiwork.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Deployment to AWS
1. Launch an **AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance**.
2. Install Java & MySQL on the server.
3. Transfer your JAR file using SCP:
   ```sh
   scp target/apiwork-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar ubuntu@your-aws-ip:/home/ubuntu/
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   java -jar apiwork-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```
5. Configure **Nginx** or **Apache** as a reverse proxy for production.


## Backup Schemes

In this section, we explain three common backup schemes used in IT environments, including how each is executed, along with their advantages and disadvantages.

 1. FULL BACKUP
 2.  How it Works:
A full backup is a complete copy of all data, files, or systems at a specific point in time. Every time a full backup runs, it creates a new copy of all the files regardless of whether they have changed or not.

‚úÖ Advantages:
Easy to restore: Restoring is simple and fast since everything is in one backup set.

Reliable: Since it includes everything, no file is left behind.

‚ùå Disadvantages:
Time-consuming: Takes a long time to complete, especially for large datasets.

Storage-intensive: Requires more disk space than other methods.

Ideal for periodic (e.g., weekly) backups combined with incremental or differential in between.


üîÑ 2. INCREMENTAL BACKUP
 How it Works:
An incremental backup saves only the changes made since the last backup (either full or incremental). For example:

Monday: Full Backup

Tuesday: Incremental (changes since Monday)

Wednesday: Incremental (changes since Tuesday), and so on...

‚úÖ Advantages:
Efficient in storage and time: Saves space and time by only backing up what changed.

Fast backup process: Especially good for daily or hourly backups.

‚ùå Disadvantages:
Slower to restore: Requires the last full backup and every incremental backup since then.

Higher complexity: Dependency on all backup files to restore successfully.

Ideal for systems where data changes frequently and backups must be taken regularly (e.g., every few hours).

3. DIFFERENTIAL BACKUP
 How it Works:
A differential backup saves all the changes made since the last full backup. For example:

Monday: Full Backup

Tuesday: Differential (changes since Monday)

Wednesday: Differential (changes since Monday), and so on‚Ä¶

‚úÖ Advantages:
Faster restore than incremental: Only need the full backup + the latest differential.

Middle ground: Balances time and storage efficiency.

‚ùå Disadvantages:
More storage over time: Each day‚Äôs differential backup grows larger until the next full backup.

Slower backup than incremental: Because it accumulates more data.

Useful when restore speed is important, but you also want to avoid daily full backups.
