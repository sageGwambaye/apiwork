# APIWork - Student & Subject API

## Overview
APIWork is a RESTful API built using **Spring Boot** and **MySQL**. It provides endpoints to fetch student details and subjects offered in the **Software Engineering** program from Year 1 to Year 4.

## Features
- Retrieve a list of students and their enrolled programs.
- Retrieve a structured list of subjects categorized by academic year.
- Uses **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **MySQL** as the database.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** (Backend Framework)
- **Spring Data JPA** (Database Interaction)
- **MySQL** (Database)
- **Postman** (API Testing)
- **AWS** (Deployment)
- **GitHub** (Version Control)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Java 17 or later
- MySQL Database
- Maven
- Git

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apiwork.git
cd apiwork
```

### Configure Database
Update **`application.properties`** (located in `src/main/resources/`):
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/apiwork
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

### Build and Run the Application
```sh
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Get All Students
**Endpoint:** `GET /students`
- **Description:** Returns a list of students and their enrolled programs.
- **Response Example:**
```json
[
  { "name": "Juma Hassan", "program": "Software Engineering" },
  { "name": "Neema John", "program": "Computer Science" }
]
```

### 2. Get Subjects by Year
**Endpoint:** `GET /subjects`
- **Description:** Returns subjects categorized by academic year.
- **Response Example:**
```json
{
  "Year 1": ["Introduction to Programming", "Mathematics for Computing"],
  "Year 2": ["Object-Oriented Programming", "Database Systems"],
  "Year 3": ["Software Architecture", "Machine Learning"],
  "Year 4": ["Cloud Computing", "Cyber Security"]
}
```

## Testing with Postman
1. Open **Postman**.
2. Use `GET http://localhost:8080/students` to fetch student data.
3. Use `GET http://localhost:8080/subjects` to fetch subjects.

## Version Control with Git
### Initialize Repository
```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/apiwork.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Deployment to AWS
1. Launch an **AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance**.
2. Install Java & MySQL on the server.
3. Transfer your JAR file using SCP:
   ```sh
   scp target/apiwork-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar ubuntu@your-aws-ip:/home/ubuntu/
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   java -jar apiwork-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```
5. Configure **Nginx** or **Apache** as a reverse proxy for production.

## Bash Scripts Overview
The system includes a set of automation Bash scripts to help with server and API maintenance.

### health_check.sh
- **Purpose:** Performs a server health check (CPU, memory, disk usage) and logs results.
- **Dependencies:** `top`, `df`, `free`, `uptime`, and `curl`

### backup_api.sh
- **Purpose:** Backs up the API project folder and the MySQL database.
- **Dependencies:** `tar`, `mysqldump`

### update_server.sh
- **Purpose:** Updates the Linux system packages and pulls new changes for the API from Git.
- **Dependencies:** `apt`, `git`

### Setup & Execution
1. Give execution permission to each script:
```sh
chmod +x health_check.sh backup_api.sh update_server.sh
```

2. Run a script manually (example):
```sh
./health_check.sh
```
If permission is denied, run it with sudo:
```sh
sudo ./health_check.sh
```

3. Setup automatic execution with crontab:
```sh
crontab -e
```
Then add:
```
0 */6 * * * /home/ubuntu/bash_scripts/health_check.sh
0 2 * * * /home/ubuntu/bash_scripts/backup_api.sh
0 3 */3 * * /home/ubuntu/bash_scripts/update_server.sh
```

## Backup Schemes

In this section, we explain three common backup schemes used in IT environments, including how each is executed, along with their advantages and disadvantages.

### 1. FULL BACKUP
**How it Works:**
A full backup is a complete copy of all data, files, or systems at a specific point in time. Every time a full backup runs, it creates a new copy of all the files regardless of whether they have changed or not.

‚úÖ **Advantages:**
- Easy to restore: Restoring is simple and fast since everything is in one backup set.
- Reliable: Since it includes everything, no file is left behind.

‚ùå **Disadvantages:**
- Time-consuming: Takes a long time to complete, especially for large datasets.
- Storage-intensive: Requires more disk space than other methods.

üí° *Ideal for periodic (e.g., weekly) backups combined with incremental or differential in between.*

### 2. INCREMENTAL BACKUP
**How it Works:**
An incremental backup saves only the changes made since the last backup (either full or incremental).

‚úÖ **Advantages:**
- Efficient in storage and time: Saves space and time by only backing up what changed.
- Fast backup process: Especially good for daily or hourly backups.

‚ùå **Disadvantages:**
- Slower to restore: Requires the last full backup and every incremental backup since then.
- Higher complexity: Dependency on all backup files to restore successfully.

üí° *Ideal for systems where data changes frequently and backups must be taken regularly (e.g., every few hours).*

### 3. DIFFERENTIAL BACKUP
**How it Works:**
A differential backup saves all the changes made since the last full backup.

‚úÖ **Advantages:**
- Faster restore than incremental: Only need the full backup + the latest differential.
- Middle ground: Balances time and storage efficiency.

‚ùå **Disadvantages:**
- More storage over time: Each day‚Äôs differential backup grows larger until the next full backup.
- Slower backup than incremental: Because it accumulates more data.

üí° *Useful when restore speed is important, but you also want to avoid daily full backups.*
